quote: I trying to do million things. Dreams, plans of the future, trying to keep track on my head Where’s everything, and am I getting where I want to get. You can start feeling like juggler. I’ve got about 40 million balls on the air and I can't focusing on any of them. I have to kind of bring it all down, and make a list what is that I know that I can say, I can do, I can do well. And focus on that.
