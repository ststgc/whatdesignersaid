quote: Costly solitions can never be a product of good design because economy is at the essence of the design expression. Economy doesn’t mean cheap design. Economy in design is the most appropriate and lean solution to every problem. Contrived solutions are never good nor long lasting. Quality is not necessarily more expensive than cheap solutions. Good design doesn’t cost more than bad design. The opposite is quite true, very often.
