I do not like typography intended as an expression of the self, as a pretext for pictorial exercises.</a><a class="tag__item-list" href="/typography/">In order to draw attention to that issue I made an exhibition showing work that we had done over many years by using only four typefaces: Garamond, Bodoni, Century Expanded, and Helvetica. —Besides those already mentioned, I can add Optima, Futura, Univers (the most advanced design of the century since it comes in 59 variations of the same face), Caslon, Baskerville, and a few other modern cuts.</a><a class="tag__item-list" href="/we-like/">We like a typography that transcends subjectivity and searches for objective values, a typography that is beyond times - that doesn’t follow trends, that reflects its content in an appropriate manner.</a><a class="tag__item-list" href="/we-think/">We think good Design is always an expression of creative strength bringing forward clear concepts expressed in beautiful form and color, where every element expresses the content in the most forceful way.</a><a class="tag__item-list" href="/poin/">Design is a discipline, a creative process with its own rules, controlling the consistency of its output toward its objective in the most direct and expressive way.</a><a class="tag__item-list" href="/disguised/">I trying to do million things.
